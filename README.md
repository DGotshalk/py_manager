# The purpose of this project is to make a project manager so I can better keep track of my projects
I have a hard time thinking of project ideas, so I decided what if I made my project manager? I want to be able to launch new projects to my github through an easier command line interface, as see the last time I updated projects. 
## Wanted capabilites:
- Be able to see a list of all projects, and a brief description of these projects
- Be able to see the last change, of each project, and maybe the comit message/what the next plan for each branch is
- Be able to jump to any of my projects at any time
- Able to create new projects at any given time. 

*The scope of this project is up to adjustment and any given time :)*
